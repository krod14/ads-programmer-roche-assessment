Question 4: GenAI Clinical Data Assistant (LLM & LangChain)

Objective

Develop a Generative AI Assistant that translates natural language questions into structured Pandas queries, enabling clinical safety reviewers to explore adverse event data without knowing specific column names or SQL syntax.

Overview

This solution demonstrates the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) and LangChain to create an intelligent data assistant that:
Understands clinical domain terminology
Maps natural language to structured data queries
Executes Pandas operations dynamically
Returns relevant results with subject counts and IDs
