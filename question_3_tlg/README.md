Question 3: TLG - Adverse Events Reporting

Objective

Create regulatory-compliant Tables, Listings, and Graphs (TLGs) for adverse events summary using the ADAE dataset, demonstrating proficiency in clinical reporting with {gtsummary} and {ggplot2}.

Overview

This solution creates three key outputs for adverse events analysis:
Summary Table - Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) by treatment group
Plot 1 - AE severity distribution visualization (bar chart/heatmap)
Plot 2 - Top 10 most frequent AEs with 95% confidence intervals
