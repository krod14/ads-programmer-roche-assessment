ADS Programmer Coding Assessment

Repository Overview

This repository contains my solutions to the Pharmaverse Expertise and Python Coding Assessment. The assessment evaluates proficiency in clinical trial data programming using R and Python, focusing on CDISC standards (SDTM and ADaM) and modern data science tools.

Questions Summary

Question 1: SDTM DS Domain Creation using {sdtm.oak}

Creates an SDTM Disposition (DS) domain dataset from raw clinical trial data using the {sdtm.oak} package, demonstrating proficiency with CDISC SDTM standards and Pharmaverse tools.
Key Technologies: R, {sdtm.oak}, {dplyr}, SDTM IG v3.4

Question 2: ADaM ADSL Dataset Creation

Develops an ADaM Subject-Level Analysis Dataset (ADSL) from SDTM source data using {admiral} and tidyverse packages, including custom derivations for age grouping, treatment timing, and patient flags.
Key Technologies: R, {admiral}, {dplyr}, {tidyr}, ADaM standards

Question 3: TLG - Adverse Events Reporting

Creates regulatory-compliant Tables, Listings, and Graphs (TLGs) for adverse events analysis, including summary tables and visualizations using modern R packages.
Key Technologies: R, {gtsummary}, {ggplot2}, {gt}

Question 4: GenAI Clinical Data Assistant (Bonus)

Builds a generative AI assistant that translates natural language questions into structured Pandas queries for clinical trial data exploration using LLMs and LangChain.
Key Technologies: Python, LangChain, OpenAI API, Pandas
